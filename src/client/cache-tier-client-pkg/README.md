Imagine you have a set of static files you want to serve 
to the world. Cache-tier allows you to quickly spin up a 
Linux web server in a location with cheap, plentiful 
bandwidth and serve those files to your users.

The cache-tier client simplifies and optimizes communication
with the cache-tier server available on GitHub at 
[github.com/mikeckennedy/cache-tier](https://github.com/mikeckennedy/cache-tier)
